Don't you notice how... I get quiet when theres no one else.. around. Me and you and awkward silence. Don't you dare look at me that way. I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same. Oh the burning pain, listening to you harp on bout some new soulmate, she so perfect blah blah blah, oh how I wish.. you wake up one day. Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say... That when I talk to you, oh cupid walks right through, and shoots an arrow through my heart <3 and I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too, confess I loved you from the start. c: c: c:
What's a girl to do, lying on my bed staring into the blue, unrequited terrifying. Love is driving me a bit insane, have to get this off my chest, im telling you today. That when I talk to you oh cupid walks right through and shoots an arrow through my heart, and I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too. Confess I loved you from the start...
Confess I loved you, just thinking of youuuu... I know... i loved you from the.. start.
